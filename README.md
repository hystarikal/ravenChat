# Project Description
This is a simple web-based chat application. The application consists of a login menu, an online users menu, and a window to displays all of the broadcasted messages. This is the MVP that I have planned for this project. Once those are completed I plan on adding other functionalities to the application such as private messaging between yours both one-two-one and group chats, as well as the creation of multiple threads. 

To run the program you first need to make sure your computer has Node.js installed. To do this you can verify that node is installed on your machine by running the terminal command "node -v". This will also tell you which version of node you have currently installed in your machine. Once you have made sure that node is installed the only two dependencies that you will need to install is socket.io and express. To install socket.io change into the correct directory, in this case "OSS_Project", and run the terminal command "npm install socket.io --save". This will install socket.io. To install express make sure you are still in the directory "OSS_Project", then type the terminal command "npm install express --save". To run the program, type the terminal command "node index.js", and then go to http://localhost:3000 in a browser of your choice.
